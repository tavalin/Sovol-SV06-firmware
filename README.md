# üö® _One-Stop-Shop_ Sovol SV06 Klipper Configuration

This repository contains the Klipper configuration and firmware for the **Sovol SV06 Plus** 3D printer.

For the **Sovol SV06**, please refer to the [master](https://github.com/bassamanator/Sovol-SV06-firmware/tree/master) branch.

If you wanted to use the One-Stop-Shop Klipper Configuration for a _different printer_, please switch to the [any-printer](https://github.com/bassamanator/Sovol-SV06-firmware/tree/any-printer) branch.

I am creating these files for my personal use and cannot be held responsible for what it might do to your printer. Use at your own risk.

üôèüèª üôåüèª Big thanks to [blanchas3d](https://github.com/blanchas3d) in testing out this branch and reporting issues.

# Highlights

- üí• This Klipper configuration is an _endpoint_, meaning that it contains **everything** that you could possibly need in order to have an excellent Klipper experience! üí•
- `NEW` <img src="./images/party_blob.gif" width="20" alt=''/> Filament runout sensor usage implemented. <img src="./images/party_blob.gif" width="20" alt=''/>
- Minimum configuration settings for Mainsail/Fluiddpi to work.
- SuperSlicer config bundle that contains the printer configuration, as well as what are considered by many to be the best print settings available for any FDM printer ([Ellis' SuperSlicer Profiles](https://github.com/AndrewEllis93/Ellis-SuperSlicer-Profiles)). Find the differences between the different print setting profiles [here](https://github.com/AndrewEllis93/Ellis-SuperSlicer-Profiles/tree/master/SuperSlicer). But basically, the 45 degree profile places the seam at the back.
- Bed model and texture to use in SuperSlicer/PrusaSlicer.
- Macros
  - **Improved** mechanical gantry calibration/`G34` macro that provides the user audio feedback, and time to check the calibration.
  - Misc macros: `PRINT_START`, `CANCEL_PRINT`, `PRINT_END`, `PAUSE`, `RESUME`.
  - Parking macros (parks the printhead at various locations): `PARKFRONT`, `PARKFRONTLOW`, `PARKREAR`, `PARKCENTER`, `PARKBED`.
  - Load/unload filament macros.
  - Purge line macro.

## Stay Up-to-Date

I work on this repository all the time and a lot of new features are coming. Watch releases of this repository to be notified for future updates:

# Preface

Although I've made switching over to Klipper as easy as is possible, it can still be a challenge for some, especially considering that most of you have likely never used GNU+Linux. Save yourself the frustration, and fully read all documentation found on this page. Also note that Klipper is not a _must_, and is not for everyone. You can stick with Marlin, and have a fine 3D printing experience.

# Installation Steps

## Before You Begin

- On the SV06 Plus, your screen will not work if you install Klipper. You can get it working again via the instructions found [here](https://github.com/fryc88/klipper-sv06plus-screen).
- Read this documentation _fully!_
- Make sure your printer is in good physical condition, because print and travel speeds will be _a lot faster_ than they were before. Consider yourself warned.
- Follow the steps in order.
- If an error was reported at a step, do no proceed to the next step.
- It is assumed that you are connected to your host Raspberry Pi (or other host device) via SSH, and that your printer motherboard is connected to the host via a data USB cable. Note that most of the micro USB cables that you find at home are _unlikely_ to be data cables, and it's not possible to tell just by looking.
- It is also assumed that the username on the host device is `pi`. If that is not the case, you will have to manually edit `moonraker.conf` and `cfgs/misc-macros.cfg` and change any mentions of `/home/pi` to `/home/yourUserName`.
- Klipper _must_ be installed on the host Raspberry Pi for everything to work. Easiest is to use a [~~FluiddPI~~](https://docs.fluidd.xyz/installation/fluiddpi#download) (‚ö†Ô∏è `FluiddPI` is not under active maintenance) or [MainsailOS](https://github.com/mainsail-crew/mainsail/releases/latest) image. Alternatively, you can install `Fluidd` or `Mainsail` via [KIAUH](https://github.com/th33xitus/kiauh).
- Robert Redford's performance in _Spy Game (2001)_ was superb!
- It is assumed that there is one instance of Klipper installed. If you have multiple instances of Klipper installed, via `KIAUH` for example, then this guide is not for you. You can still use all the configs of course, but the steps in this guide will likely not work for you.
- Your question has probably been answered already, but if it hasn't, please post in the [Discussion](https://github.com/bassamanator/Sovol-SV06-firmware/discussions) section.
- I would recommend searching for the word `NOTE` in this repository. There are roughly half a dozen short points amongst the various files that you should be aware of if you're using this configuration.

## Flash Firmware

üí° _If you have already flashed klipper onto your motherboard in the past, you can skip this step._

üí° For the sake of simplicity, I will refer to the klipper firmware file as `klipper.bin` even though the actual filename is something along the lines of `klipper-v0.11.0-148-g52f4e20c.bin`.

üí° The firmware file is located in the `misc` folder.

### Prepare the microSD Card for Flashing

‚ö†Ô∏è Many users have reported having issues flashing Klipper using the Sovol microSD card.

- Size: `8GB`. According to Sovol, the largest size that you can use is `16GB`.
- File system: `FAT32`.
- Allocation unit size: `4096 bytes`.
- Must not contain any files _except_ the firmware file.

### Flashing Procedure

1. Disconnect any USB cables that might be connected to the motherboard.
2. Copy `klipper.bin` to the microSD card.
3. Make sure the printer is off.
4. Insert the microSD card into printer.
5. Turn on the printer and wait a minute (usually takes 10 seconds).
6. Turn off the printer and remove the microSD.

You may find this [video](https://youtu.be/p6l253OJa34) useful.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Caveat**: Flashing will only work if current firmware filename is _different from previous flashing procedure_. The `.bin` is also important.

## Download Klipper Configuration

You can choose _either_ of the 2 following methods.

### Method 1: Clone the Repository

1. `cd ~/printer_data/config`
2. Empty entire `~/printer_data/config` folder. Unfortunately, for safety reasons I will not post this command here. However, in linux, you can delete files via `rm filename`.
3. `git clone -b sv06-plus --single-branch https://github.com/bassamanator/Sovol-SV06-firmware.git .` üí° Don't miss the period!

### Method 2: Download the ZIP

1. [Download](https://github.com/bassamanator/Sovol-SV06-firmware/archive/refs/heads/sv06-plus.zip) the `ZIP` file containing the Klipper configuration.
2. See `Step 2` in `Method 1`.
3. The parent folder in the `ZIP` is `Sovol-SV06-firmware-sv06-plus`. This is relevant in the next step.
4. Extract **only** the _contents_ of the parent folder into `~/printer_data/config`.

## Initial Steps

### Step 1

1. Find what port the `mcu` (printer motherboard) is connected to via `ls -l /dev/serial/by-id/` or `ls -l /dev/serial/by-path/`.
   1. The output will be something along the lines of
      `lrwxrwxrwx 13 root root  22 Apr 11:10  usb-1a86_USB2.0-Serial-if00-port0 -> ../../ttyUSB0`.
   2. `usb-1a86_USB2.0-Serial-if00-port0` is the relevant part.
   3. Therefore, the full path to your `mcu` is either `/dev/serial/by-id/usb-1a86_USB2.0-Serial-if00-port0` or `/dev/serial/by-path/usb-1a86_USB2.0-Serial-if00-port0`, depending on the command you used to find the `mcu`.
2. Adjust the `[mcu]` section in `printer.cfg` accordingly.
   This is just an _example_ `mcu` section:

   ```
   [mcu]
   serial: /dev/serial/by-id/usb-1a86_USB2.0-Serial-if00-port0
   restart_method: command
   ```

### Step 2

‚ùó‚ò†Ô∏è **Your finger should be on the power switch for most of these steps** ‚ò†Ô∏è‚ùó

‚ùó‚ò†Ô∏è **Power off if there is a collision/problem** ‚ò†Ô∏è‚ùó

üí° I recommend no filament be loaded for any of these steps.

üí° Find explanations for gcode commands at [https://marlinfw.org/](https://marlinfw.org/) and [klipper.org](https://www.klipper3d.org/G-Codes.html).

You will be pasting/typing these commands into the Mainsail/Fluidd console.

1. `G28`
   1. Check to see if `X` and `Y` max positions (`G90`, `G1 X300 F3000`, `G1 Y300 F3000`) can be reached, and adjust `position_max`, if necessary. Note, you might be able to go even further.
2. Do a `G34`; mechanical gantry calibration. After the controlled collision against the beam at the top, there will be a 10 second pause for you to verify that both sides of the gantry are pressed up against the `stoppers` at the top. ~~You will hear a succession of beeps.~~
   1. Figure out your `Z` `position_max` by baby stepping your way up to the beam (`G90`, `G1 Z330 F900`, then move up mm by mm). Adjust `position_max`, if necessary.
3. Pid tune the bed, but first move the printhead to the center. Ideally, all Pid tuning should occur at the temperatures that you print most at.
   1. `G28`
   2. `G90`
   3. `G1 X150 Y150 Z40 F6000`
   4. `PID_CALIBRATE HEATER=heater_bed TARGET=70`
   5. `SAVE_CONFIG` (once completed)
4. Pid tune the extruder while part cooling fan runs at 25%.
   1. `G28`
   2. `G90`
   3. `G1 X150 Y150 Z10 F6000`
   4. `M106 S64`
   5. `PID_CALIBRATE HEATER=extruder TARGET=245`
   6. `SAVE_CONFIG` (once completed)
5. Adjust `z_offset`. Make sure your nozzle if very clean. Do the [Paper test](https://www.klipper3d.org/Bed_Level.html?h=probe_calibrate#the-paper-test).
   1. `SET_HEATER_TEMPERATURE HEATER=heater_bed TARGET=60`
   2. `SET_HEATER_TEMPERATURE HEATER=extruder TARGET=180`
   3. Proceed to next steps after both temperatures have been reached.
   4. `G28`
   5. `PROBE_CALIBRATE`
   6. `SAVE_CONFIG` (once completed)
6. Create a bed mesh.
   1. `SET_HEATER_TEMPERATURE HEATER=heater_bed TARGET=60`
   2. `SET_HEATER_TEMPERATURE HEATER=extruder TARGET=180`
   3. Proceed to next steps after both temperatures have been reached.
   4. `G28`
   5. `BED_MESH_CALIBRATE`
   6. `SAVE_CONFIG` (once completed)

If you've made it here, then your printer has been Klipperized, and is ready to print!

But first, adjust your slicer.

## Adjust Your Slicer

You need to adjust the start and end gcode in your slicer. The relevant macros are `PRINT_START` and `PRINT_END`. Find instructions [here](https://ellis3dp.com/Print-Tuning-Guide/articles/passing_slicer_variables.html#slicer-start-g-code).

If you would like to print a purge line before your print starts, at the end of your start gcode, on a new line add `PURGE_LINE`. Here's an example:

```
PRINT_START BED=[first_layer_bed_temperature] HOTEND={first_layer_temperature[initial_extruder]+extruder_temperature_offset[initial_extruder]} CHAMBER=[chamber_temperature]
PURGE_LINE
```

## FAQ

##### How do I import a SuperSlicer configuration bundle (`SuperSlicer_config_bundle.ini`) into SuperSlicer?

Please see [this discussion](https://github.com/bassamanator/Sovol-SV06-firmware/discussions/13).

##### How do I print using SuperSlicer?

Please see [this discussion](https://github.com/bassamanator/Sovol-SV06-firmware/discussions/14).

##### When does beeping occur?

üí° Beeping will likely not work on the SV06 Plus. I recommend not turning it on.

The printer will beep upon:

- Filament runout.
- Filament change/`M600`.
- Upon `PRINT_END`.
- `MECHANICAL_GANTRY_CALIBRATION`/`G34`.

##### How do I disable beeping?

Make the following changes according to your needs. All beeping will be disabled _except_ during gantry calibration.

| File            | `cfgs/misc-macros.cfg`     |
| --------------- | -------------------------- |
| Section         | `[gcode_macro _globals]`   |
| Variable        | `variable_beeping_enabled` |
| Disable beeping | `0`                        |
| Enable beeping  | `1`                        |

##### I want to use a filament sensor. How do I set it up?

You can find information about the physical setup [here](https://github.com/bassamanator/everything-sovol-sv06#filament-sensor).

##### I have a simple filament sensor connected. How do I enable/disable it?

Make the following changes according to your needs.

| File           | `cfgs/misc-macros.cfg`             |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Section        | `[gcode_macro _globals]`           |
| Variable       | `variable_filament_sensor_enabled` |
| Disable sensor | `0`                                |
| Enable sensor  | `1`                                |

##### My filament runout sensor works, but I just started a print without any filament loaded. What gives?

A simple runout sensor can only detect a change in state. So, if you start a print without filament loaded, the printer will not know that there is no filament loaded. You should test your sensor by having filament loaded, starting a print, then cutting the filament. The expected behaviour is that the print will pause, and as long as you have beeping enabled, you will hear 3 annoying beeps.

##### What happens when I put in `M600`/colour change at a certain layer?

1. The printer will beep 3 times (not annoyingly).
2. Printing will stop.
3. The printhead will park itself front center.
4. The hotend will turn off, but the bed will remain hot.

##### What happens when I pause a print?

Same behaviour as `M600`/colour change _except_ there won't be any beeping.

##### What happens when filament runs out?

_If_ you have a working filament sensor, the same behaviour as `M600`/colour change will occur _except_ the beeps will be fairly annoying.

##### How do I resume a print after a colour change or filament runout?

‚ö†Ô∏è _Do not disable the stepper motors during this process!_

The printhead is now parked front center waiting for you to insert filament. You will:

1. Heat up the hotend to the desired temperature.
   - Use your Klipper dashboard.
2. Purge (push) some filament through the nozzle.
   - Use your Klipper dashboard, and extrude maybe 50mm (for a colour change you probably want to extrude more).
   - OR, you can push some filament by hand _making sure to first disengage the extruder's spring loaded arm_.
3. Hit resume in your Klipper dashboard.
